# Goodideas

This web project is a portfolio site in attempts to show my work to future clients/employers.

## Goals

The goal of this project (as of 6.5.22) is to present and push my abilities within HTML & CSS. Obviously, this is an assignment, but I do hope that my abilities as a developer and desginer come across in hopes of finding employment. Will update this readme when I'm able to invest more attributes when class is over.

Attempts will be made to create something that looks unique. Current CSS knowledge will be pushed by opting for more difficult styling (gifs, slanted presentation options, higher graphic complexity).

## Models

# NOTE: I updated the goal/look of the mockup and didn't upload to README until project finalized. Amended as original project was too ambitious for timetable.
