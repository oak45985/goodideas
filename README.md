# Goodideas

This web project is a portfolio site in attempts to show my work to future clients/employers.

## Goals

The goal of this project (as of 6.5.22) is to present and push my abilities within HTML & CSS.

Attempts will be made to create something that looks unique. Current CSS knowledge will be pushed by opting for more difficult styling (gifs, slanted presentation options, higher graphic complexity).

## Models

# NOTE: I updated the goal/look of the mockup and didn't upload to README until project finalized. Amended as original project was too ambitious for timetable.
